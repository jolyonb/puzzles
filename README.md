Puzzles
=======

by Jolyon Bloomfield

This repository contains solvers for solving logic puzzles using python. Currently, we have the following solvers available:

* [Battleships (Bimaru)](battleships/README.md). Can find multiple solutions and can handle unknown clues.

These solvers are built on top of `framework.py`, which provides a mechanism for making guesses in a recursive fashion, finding multiple solutions, and backtracking.

We hope to do the following puzzles soon!

* Paint-By-Numbers (Nonogram)
* Sudoku
* 3D Battleships
