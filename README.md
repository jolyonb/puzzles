Puzzles
=======

by Jolyon Bloomfield

This repository contains solvers for solving various puzzles using python. Currently, we have the following solvers available:

* [Battleships (Bimaru)](battleships/). Can find multiple solutions and can handle unknown clues.
* [Sudoku](sudoku/). Can find multiple solutions.

Various frameworks have been written to help with different puzzle types. A generic backtracking structure is provided in `framework.py`. The dancing links algorithm for exact cover problems is coded in `links.py`.

We also have some helper routines for dealing with [word puzzles](word-puzzles/).

We hope to do the following puzzles soon!

* Paint-By-Numbers (Nonogram)
* 3D Battleships
* Hex Battleships
* Loop puzzles
