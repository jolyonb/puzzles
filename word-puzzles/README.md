Word Puzzles
============

There are a lot of different types of word puzzles, but most of them can be assisted by searching through a word list appropriately. This folder contains two files to help with this:

* words.txt, a very long wordlist from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words (370,098 words)
* wordslib.py, a library containing a collection of routines for manipulating words

Programs for specific word puzzles are also included here:

* wordsearch.py: Solves wordsearch puzzles
